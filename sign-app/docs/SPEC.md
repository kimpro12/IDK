# Sign App Product Spec

## Product
Sign is a ritual-first guidance app that blends daily intention setting with short, tangible prompts. The experience should feel calm, grounded, and emotionally supportive while still being crisp enough to use in under five minutes.

## UX Ritual
1. **Arrive**: A one-breath reset that invites the user to pause.
2. **Draw**: Present a three-card spread or single sign.
3. **Name**: Offer a short prompt that translates the sign into real-life action.
4. **Anchor**: Encourage a one-line journal entry to lock in the insight.
5. **Close**: A soft reminder to return later without guilt.

## Content Packs
- **Free pack**: 50 baseline signs that rotate across rituals.
- **Seasonal pack**: Time-bound themes (equinox, new year, personal reset).
- **Premium packs**: Curated rituals, spread templates, and deeper journaling prompts.

## Energy Rules
- Keep tone warm, grounded, and direct—no mystical jargon overload.
- Each prompt should contain a clear verb and an actionable time frame.
- Limit language to one idea per sentence; two sentences max per prompt.

## Daily Guidance
- Provide one daily prompt and one energy note.
- Reinforce consistency over streak pressure.
- Offer a single, optional action button (e.g., “Set a reminder”).

## Journal
- Journals capture: prompt, user reflection, mood tag, timestamp.
- Encourage a minimum of one sentence; avoid pressure for length.
- Allow private entries to stay offline unless user opts in to sync.

## Premium Model
